You can do prop drilling (Where components pass props through multiple layers) in a convenient way.
Put the props you need in the current layer in their own variables via deconstructing, and then put the rest into a props variable. Then pass that props variable to the next component.
```
const Book = ({style, imageUrl, children, ...props}) => {
    // ...
    <Article {...props} />
}
```

In react, you can add a click event by putting `onClick={<your callback>}` on something. For example `onClick={() => alert('clicked')}` or `onClick={callbackVariable}`
