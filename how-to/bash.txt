To check server access logs: sudo ls -lha /var/log/nginx
To restart a laravel queue: sudo supervisorctl restart live_vdkapp_queue_emails:live_vdkapp_queue_emails_00

To empty the server cache for Venapp so that the buildhook doesn't run out of memory, hopefully. (It may help to do this after each step in the deploy)
(As root):
```
sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
sudo sh -c "sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
sudo sh -c "sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
```
You can also try stopping the queues. Don't worry, these will be restarted automatically after the deploy succeeds.
(As root): 
sudo supervisorctl stop <queue-name>
For accept, this is done like this:
```
sudo supervisorctl stop accept_venapp_queue_dataroom_archive:accept_venapp_queue_dataroom_archive_00
sudo supervisorctl stop accept_venapp_queue_emails:accept_venapp_queue_emails_00
sudo supervisorctl stop accept_venapp_queue_images:accept_venapp_queue_images_00
```
