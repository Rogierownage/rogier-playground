.env values can be changed in the project's repo itself. In .hosting/environments/
The exception to this is secrets (Secret values like DB passwords). These can be managed via the kubernetes dashboard. Secrets -> <php fpm for that env> -> edit

To see errors for a project in elastic search Kibana: (Example venapp): `kubernetes.namespace: venapp and kubernetes.node.labels.node_paqt_com/environment: accept and log.level: ERROR`

To migrate a project to kubernetes (devops tasks only):
- Copy-paste the .github and .hosting directory (And change the project name to the correct one)
- Check if the environments in the deploy scripts match what you want
- Set the environment values. General values (which are the same everywhere) go in .hosting/environments/values.yaml , environment-specific ones go in .hosting/environments/<ENV>>/values.yaml , and secrets are set via .hosting/environments/variables.yaml.template
- Set the environments and services in the hosting repository. Example: https://github.com/paqtcom/hosting/blob/master/inventory/projects/venapp/applications.json

If there is a stage environment:
- Move imagePullSecrets from values.yaml to variables.yaml.template
- Define utilities.secrets.name in variables.yaml.template to be different based on the environment

If the deploy helm chart step has a timeout:
- Increase the timeout in deployment.yaml
