SUBSTRING can be used to get a part of a string. The second parameter is the starting position, and the third parameter is the length.
Example: SUBSTRING('Hello', 1, 3) // Hel
If the second parameter is negative, it starts counting from the end of the string. Then it moves forwards as normal.
If the third parameter is omitted, the entire rest of the string is returned. The third parameter can not be negative.

CONCAT can be used to concatenate multiple strings together. Use commas between each string. Accepts any amount of strings.

REPLACE can be used to do a search-replace in a string. The second parameter is the value to search for, and the third parameter is the value to replace it with.

REVERSE will simply reverse a string, putting it in the reverse order.

CHAR_LENGTH will return the length of a string.
LENGTH will return the length in bytes.

UPPER (or UCASE) will make a string uppercase
LOWER (or LCASE) will make a string lowercase

INSERT will add a string inside another string.
The first parameter is the original string.
The second parameter is the position to start adding from. I don't think this can be negative.
The third parameter is how many characters to remove. 0 to remove nothing. -1 to remove everything.
The fourth parameter is the string to insert into it.
For example, select INSERT('Hello there', 7, 2, 'wh') returns 'Hello where'

LEFT returns the left-most part of a string. The second parameter is how many characters.
RIGHT returns the right-most part of a string.

REPEAT takes a string and repeats it a number of times. The second parameter is how many times to repeat it.
Note: "Repeating" 1 time is equal to just keeping the original string.

TRIM removes a specific character from the beginning/end/both of a string. The default is the space character.
This has pretty weird syntax. Some examples:
TRIM(LEADING 'x' from name)
TRIM(BOTH '    ' from email)
TRIM(TRAILING '-' from zipcode)
